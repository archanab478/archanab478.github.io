### Projects

1. Transformer-Based Multi-Class Classification of Legal Cases for Predicting Case Outcomes
Objective: Predict legal case outcomes through multi-class classification using transformer-based pre-trained language models.
Dataset: 24,985 legal case records from Kaggle, including attributes such as case-id, case-title, and case-text.
Model: Transformer-based model categorizing cases into ten distinct outcome labels.
Training Parameters: Hyperparameters like epochs, batch size, and learning rate were fine-tuned during training.
Performance Metrics: Achieved average scores of precision (0.54), recall (0.41), and F-score (0.42).
Conclusion: Transformer models show potential in supporting judicial decision-making by accurately predicting legal case outcomes.
Technology: Python, PyTorch, Kaggle Dataset
2. Comparison of Clustering Algorithms Using the KNIME Tool
Objective: Compare K-means and Fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering algorithms for categorizing data into meaningful clusters.
Platform: KNIME analytics platform.
Datasets: Hillary Clinton's Email Repository email data. University instructor Wikipedia usage surveys.
Analysis: Assessed clustering results from K-means and FCM on diverse data types.
Findings: Highlights how clustering techniques enhance data organization and reveal insights for web mining applications.
Technology: Java 7, KNIME 2.10
3. Web Usage Mining Using Clustering
Objective: Cluster website users into groups to analyze user navigation behavior through fuzzy clustering.
Clustering Methods: Partition-based clustering: Partitions data, with each partition representing a cluster.
Hierarchical-based clustering: Creates hierarchical decomposition using three linkage methods: Single linkage, complete linkage, and average linkage.
Performance Evaluation: Evaluated using cophenetic parameters.
Results: Average linkage method achieved the highest cophenetic value (0.9673), compared to single (0.9444) and complete (0.9671) linkage methods.
Technology: C#.Net, MySQL
